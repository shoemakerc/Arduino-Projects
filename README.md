# Arduino-Projects

This repository contains a number of different programs (in varying states of completeness) for the Arduino microcontroller.  Some of these programs are pulled from sample programs that can be found on the Arduino tutorial page (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/HomePage).  Others were created as part of my 2016 summer internship at AuSIM Incorporated in Mountain View, CA, created in collaboration with William L. Chapin and Samuel McHugh.
