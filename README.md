# Arduino-Projects

This repository contains a number of different programs (in varying states of completeness) for the Arduino microcontroller.  Some of these programs are pulled from sample code that can be found on the official Arduino tutorial page (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/HomePage).  Others were created as part of my 2016 summer internship at AuSIM Incorporated (http://ausim3d.com/), Mountain View, CA, in collaboration with William L. Chapin and Samuel McHugh.
